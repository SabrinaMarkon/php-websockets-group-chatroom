TESTING

--------------------------

MEMBERS AREA:

member/visitor contact form can send to admin properly. - needs validation stuff for form on php side.

resend password request by member works. Email comes and has correct info.

resend verification request by member works. Email comes and verification link works.

updating profile from members area WITHOUT changing email works and doesn't log the user out.

updating profile from members area WITH changing the email address works, and logs out the user because they have to re-verify. 
The email comes that needs the member to re-verify, and the link works successfully.
If the user was already logged in, they don't have to again it seems, but it could be confusing because the login link is gone (the members area
nav is there already) - I've added a login link so they can either click that and login again, or click one of the members-only links in the nav. For clarity.

logout nav link works
