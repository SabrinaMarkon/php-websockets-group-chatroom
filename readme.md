PHP Group Chat App - Members Only
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stories:

- Members must register to the website.

- Members must verify their email address on the website.

- As members of the website, users can login and chat with one another either privately or in the group channel.

- The chat uses websockets.

- The websocket can be set up as a persistent service using /etc/init and chatSocket.conf

- Cron to check if service is down and start it if it is (I've seen so many issues on Stack, GitHub, etc. saying that the service dies unpredictably with few solutions.)

- The admin may login to an admin area.

- The admin can change the basic website settings from the admin area (site name, admin user/pass, domain url, etc.)

- The admin can email all members.

- The admin area allow create/edit/delete of members.

- The admin area allows the admin to edit the basic HTML content on the website pages (between the header and footer).

- The site scales well for mobile/desktop.

- The site is extremely user friendly and intuitive for a mainly non-technical community.

- The site looks and IS fun!
